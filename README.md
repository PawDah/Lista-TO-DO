<p>In this project, I followed the Laravel framework due to its greater knowledge than other frameworks and the solutions used in it that seemed easy to implement (However, it was not that easy)</p>
<p>I am satisfied with the results of my work and the subsequent hours spent developing my programming skills </p>
